# Honors Project: Predicting Rainfall

This Honors Project is optional but highly recommended. It allows you to apply the skills you've acquired throughout the five-week journey of mastering various Machine Learning algorithms.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I delved into the rainfall dataset sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. My task involves:

1. Data Cleaning: prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing missing values, outliers, and any other inconsistencies.
2. Classification Modeling: build a classifier to predict whether there will be rainfall the following day.
3. Algorithm Exploration: apply different classification algorithms to the dataset to identify the most effective approach.

**Why This Project Matters:**

Completing this project solidified my understanding of data preprocessing, classification techniques, and model evaluation. It served as a practical application of myy newly acquired skills in a real-world context.
